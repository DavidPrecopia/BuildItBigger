# Overview

This project was about demonstrating our proficiency with some of the features of Gradle (the preferred build system of Android).

In this project I had to implement:

- Multiple modules.
  - Java library
  - Android library
  - Google Cloud Endpoints
  - Front end
- Utilize different source sets.
- Add different build types (e.g., debug and prod) and flavors (e.g., paid, free, mock), and how to combine and manage them.

# Project description

In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist
of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints
(GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the
GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.
